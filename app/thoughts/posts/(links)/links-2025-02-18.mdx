#### [What’s Preventing Us from Building a Beautiful Product?](https://ben-mini.com/2025/whats-preventing-us-from-building-a-beautiful-product?__readwiseLocation=) (ben-mini)
This resonated with my a lot as a developer building a product that I don't use every day. The tools everyone loves right now (Linear, Notion, Figma, Cursor) are beautifully designed and have the advantage that the developers are actively using the product as they are building it. Ben brainstorms how his company (content platform for disability providers) can try to emulate how thoughtfully designed products are built without necessarily being able to "dogfood" the product.

#### [The Art of Making Websites](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/the-art-of-making-websites/?__readwiseLocation=) (Jim Nielsen's Blog)
Making your own website feels like making art. It's creative, can be uniquely yours or inspired by others, shared or kept to yourself, useful or useless. Most importantly, `it’s a reflection of the person/people making it. Their intentions. Their purpose.` In the world where AI is flooding the web uncreative words and designs, it's important to make your own creative mark.

#### [The Unbearable Loudness of Chewing](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/09/the-unbearable-loudness-of-chewing) (Jake Eaton, Asterisk Mag)
Universally agreed upon that certain sounds (chewing, chalkboards) are unpleasant, but [Misophonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) is a relatively under-researched disorder that gives people aversions to certain sounds. Great article from an author who has misophonia, and points out why a disorder like this should have more attention (imagine not being able to stand the sound of your own family's voices).

#### [untested](https://untested.sonnet.io/?l) (Rafał Pastuszak)
Not necessarily a single link, but I found his blog and it's really delightful to read. Short, well written posts with fun animations... a cozy site to skim through.
