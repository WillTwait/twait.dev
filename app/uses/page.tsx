            Most of us are using a computer for the majority of the day, and the
            tool we interact with this much should look beautiful, feel great,
            and work exceptionally. The M1 Pro is all that, and 4+ years later
            the performance and battery are still doing the job.

            You can decouple the magnet on the scroll wheel to supposedly scroll
            1100 lines/second, which is... nice to know you can do if you need
            to?

            I'm by no means a keyboard junkie, but mechanical keyboards are
            pretty fun to use. This one looks pretty, is reasonably priced, and
            the keys click-clack nicely.

            This is my favorite kitchen tool and I never see it on any lists.
            It's essentially a wok+dutch oven combo which seems weird but I use
            it for everything. If I had to replace all pots and pans with just a
            single one, I think this thing could do it.

            Anthony Bourdain recommended this in Kitchen Confidential which was
            good enough a recommendation for me.

            The Rolls-Royce of miniature screwdriver+wrench sets but totally
            worth it. Plus you end up using them a lot to justify owning this.

            A mechanical sound machine that drowns out NYC's mechanical and
            non-mechanical noises.

            Cursor has totally changed the way I view interacting with computers
            via code. Obviously mixed thoughts on using AI to code / abandoning
            the love of the craft... but the productivity I get using Cursor vs
            a non-assisted editor makes it so worth it.

          <Item category="✅ To-Do" name="Todoist" href="https://todoist.com/">
            One of my most used apps... I use partly as a to-do list and partly
            as a brain-dump place for thoughts to revisit later. The natural
            language scheduling is the killer feature for me that keeps me using
            Todoist over something like Apple Reminders.

            My other most used app, especially as I am trying to phase out
            algorithmic feeds for RSS, newsletters, and bookmarked articles. The
            text-to-speech feature is super cool, and helps to keep up with an
            ever growing backlog of Money Stuff newsletters.

          <Item category="✍🏼 Journaling" name="Apple Journal">
            Was pretty bare bones when first released, but lately the Journal
            app has become great. A Mac version would be nice, but as a "jot a
            few thoughts at a time" vs an essayist journalist, the phone app
            suits my needs just fine.

            Honestly not totally sold on this one yet, but giving it a try. I
            really just want a markdown editor with a pretty interface and so
            far Obsidian does the job.

          Finally, this site is built using NextJS with Tailwind styling and
