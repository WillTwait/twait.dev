Things I use and enjoy enough to recommend.
*(Updated 2025-02-17)*
# Hardware
💻 **Computer**: MacBook Pro M1 (14", Space Gray). 
Most of us are using a computer for the majority of the day, and the tool we interact with this much should look beautiful, feel great, and work exceptionally. The M1 Pro is all that, and 4+ years later the performance and battery are still doing the job. 

🐭 **Mouse**: [Logitech MX Master](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.html).
You can decouple the magnet on the scroll wheel to supposedly scroll 1100 lines/second, which is... nice to know you can do if you need to?

⌨️ **Keyboard**: [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39900390686809) (White Non-Backlit, Brown Switches).
I'm by no means a keyboard junkie, but mechanical keyboards are pretty fun to use. This one looks pretty, is reasonably priced, and the keys click-clack nicely.

*Normally folks just throw techy stuff here, but other tools are worth sharing too!*

🥘 **Pan**: [Staub Perfect Pan](https://www.zwilling.com/us/staub-cast-iron---woks%2F-perfect-pans-12-inch-perfect-pan-graphite-grey-1312918/40511-462-0.html?cgid=our-brands_staub_cast-iron_woks-perfect-pans) (12", 4.5qt, Graphite Grey).
This is my favorite kitchen tool and I never see it on any lists. It's essentially a wok+dutch oven combo which seems weird but I use it for everything. If I had to replace all pots and pans with just a single one, I think this thing could do it.

🔪 **Kitchen Knife**: [Global G-2](https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/classic-g-2) (8").
Anthony Bourdain recommended this in Kitchen Confidential which was good enough a recommendation for me.

🪛 **Home Toolkit**: [Wera Tool Check Plus](https://products.wera.de/en/bits_holders_adaptors_and_sets_bit_sets_tool-checks_and_bit-checks_with_zyklop_mini_ratchet_tool-check_plus.html.html).
The Rolls-Royce of miniature screwdriver+wrench sets but totally worth it. Plus you end up using them a lot to justify owning this.

# Software
📝 **Notes**: Apple Notes.
It just works.

🧑‍💻 **Code Editor**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).
Cursor has totally changed the way I view interacting with computers via code. Obviously mixed thoughts on using AI to code / abandoning the love of the craft... but the productivity I get using Cursor vs a non-assisted editor makes it so worth it.

🌐 Browser: Arc
To fit in at NYC WeWorks.

✅ **To-Do**: Todoist.
One of my most used apps... I use partly as a to-do list and partly as a brain-dump place for thoughts to revisit later. The natural language scheduling is the killer feature for me that keeps me using Todoist over something like Apple Reminders.

📑 **Read It Later**: Readwise Reader.
My other most used app, especially as I am trying to phase out algorithmic feeds for RSS, newsletters, and bookmarked articles. The text-to-speech feature is super cool, and helps to keep up with an ever growing backlog of Money Stuff newsletters.

📖 **RSS**: Readwise Reader.

📰 **News**: NYT App, Readwise Reader (for news newsletters).

✍🏼 **Journaling**: Apple Journal
Was pretty bare bones when first released, but lately the Journal app has become great. A Mac version would be nice, but as a "jot a few thoughts at a time" vs an essayist journalist, the phone app suits my needs just fine.

📜 **Word Processing**: Obsidian
Honestly not totally sold on this one yet, but giving it a try. I really just want a markdown editor with a pretty interface and so far Obsidian does the job.

Finally, this site is built using NextJS with Tailwind styling and hosted with Vercel. Is a fancy React framework overkill for a mostly static site? Maybe, but it's what I'm most familiar with.
